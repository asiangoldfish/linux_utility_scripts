# Simple Build

Automate the build process for developing projects

Simple Build is meant to be a starting point to automate the build process
of your project. It's designed to work as a macro for development systems like
Make, CMake and Clang. By default it'll detect whether the project uses Make
or CMake, and thereafter build the project accordingly.
